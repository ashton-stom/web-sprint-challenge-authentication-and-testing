Unit tests are testing individual tests, integration is where tests check to see how things run with the rest of the code. End-to-end is testing interaction from the client side.

4.  How does Test Driven Development change the way we write applications and tests?
We write the tests first so that we can have fast feedback on the code we are writing. This can prevent a lot of errors.
